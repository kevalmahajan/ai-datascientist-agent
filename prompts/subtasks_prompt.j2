Break down the given coding task into a minimal set of self-contained subtasks. Each subtask should correspond to a logically complete unit of code (e.g., a single code cell or block) and include only essential steps.
Avoid splitting tightly coupled actions. Each subtask must be clearly defined so that a language model can generate full code for that block without additional context.
If there's a ask for creating a function or a class, the function or class should be created in one subtask only.
Do not write code; only give the description of the subtasks. A simple string which contains well formatted list of subtasks.
Task: {{ task }}
